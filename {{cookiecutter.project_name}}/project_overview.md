# Project Overview

Protip: To "warm up" Claude-Dev give it initial context of your main development background:
@/README.md @/developer_notes.md @/todo.md @/ux_overview.md

## Overview

This is a simple test project using ClaudeDev. It consists of the following components:
 - component1
 - component2
 - component3

Tech stack:
 - Python 3.10
 - SQLite3
 - Bash (for Linux) or Zsh (for Mac)

## KEY_REQUIREMENTS
 
 - before you begin coding, create a new git branch named 'claude-dev' and checkout that branch to do your work
 - document all python scripts with verbose comments
 - document all shell scripts with verbose comments and chmod them to be executable
 - document all SQL files with verbose comment
 - when you complete a group tasks, commit your changes to the git repository
 - as you complete tasks, update the corresponding item in the 'todo.md' file to indicate that the task is complete
 - as you complete tasks, update the 'developer_notes.md' file to document your progress and any issues you encountered
  your progress and any issues you encountered
 - if you are unable to do a task or get confused, please ask questions of clarification to me
 - after you have completed all tasks in todo.md, update the tests/test_all_code.py file with appropriate unit tests
 - after you have completed all tasks in todo.md, offer to create a Makefile so that I can run tests and run the main program script
 - after you have completed all listed tasks, create a pull request to merge your 'claude-dev' branch into the 'main' branch
 
### GRATITUDE
 
I appreciate your help and I am grateful to have you as a coding partner.

### Constraints:
